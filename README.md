```bash
$ poetry add psqlpy-piccolo
```

## Usage

DB = PSQLPyEngine(
    config={
        "host": os.environ.get("PG_HOST", "127.0.0.1"),
        "port": os.environ.get("PG_PORT", 5432),
        "user": os.environ.get("PG_USER", "postgres"),
        "password": os.environ.get("PG_PASSWORD", "postgres"),
